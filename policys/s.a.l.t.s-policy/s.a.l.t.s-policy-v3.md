* No notice will be given on archiving or retiring a plan or removing availability; however, We believe in an open dialect with our customers. That said, business reason depends, We will provide information in the form of an announcement when possible.

#### Other Limitation(s)

All Plans/Tiers are subject to other limitations, detailed below.

## Activation

1. User Invites RITA to server >
2. User Joins RMS Server >
3. User selects relevant plan provided by Patreon >
4. User completes payment via platform
   1. Patreon > Payment is handled by Patreon
5. Upon Confirmation of payment User activates Discord integration through account linking.
   1. Guide for [Patreon](../../premium/how-to-subscribe/patreon.md)
6. Integration uses the Patreon Bot to apply relevant roles to User, a Role from Payment, Tier, and the Subscription section below are needed for RITA to work.
7. RITA detects role additions and adds relevant and required data to our Subscription Database
8. Once User has all identifying Roles they are able to see the channel #activate-rita-here.
   1. If role addition fails or is incomplete, then it is investigated by the ADMIN team. The ADMIN team will manually validate payment completion and then apply correct roles, if necessary.
9. User types \`!tr sub\` in the above noted channel or in their own server. If they own more than one server or are admin in more than one server, then they are prompted to select the server they want to use RITA in.
   1. RITA must be in the server before the command is run, else an error will be provided.
10. RITA is activated and the subscription process is completed.

## Limitations

**Each plan has the following limitation applied.**

Due to the rising cost of our Hosting, Charges to Google and Payment Processing Services, we have made changes to the character limitations applied to each plan, this will take effect on the 1st of May 2023

<table><thead><tr><th width="281">Plan Name</th><th>Task Limit</th><th width="172">Char Limit</th><th width="155">Engine Used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td></tr><tr><td>The OG "Casual" Plan</td><td>100</td><td>200,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Casual" Plan - Offer</td><td>100</td><td>200,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Casual" Plan</td><td>100</td><td>200,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The OG "Tinkerer" Plan</td><td>200</td><td>400,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Tinkerer" Plan - Offer</td><td>200</td><td>400,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Tinkerer" Plan</td><td>200</td><td>400,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The OG "Pro" Plan</td><td>350</td><td>600,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Pro" Plan - Offer</td><td>350</td><td>600,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>The "Pro" Plan</td><td>350</td><td>600,000 Soft Cap</td><td>Google API / ML</td></tr><tr><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td><td>REDACTED</td></tr></tbody></table>

_Soft Cap = not enforced to the digit but close._ This is calculated by

_(_Number of Characters in message \* Number of languages translated to) + Original Char Count = Total Char Count.

* Example from English to French: Hello -> Bonjour
  * (5 Characters \* 1 language translation) + 5 original chars = 10 Total Chars

1. Exceeding Character Limit. Either of the following Scenarios are taken, via automation by RITA or manual intervention by a member of RMS Staff
   * A server exceeds the soft caps assigned to their plan
   * Translation Services are swapped from Implicit Google API Translation to Implicit Machine Learning API Translation for Languages we have trained and that are optimized to a high standard. See [Machine Learning API](s.a.l.t.s-policy-v3.md#machine-learning-api) for more information.
   * At the start of the next calendar month Implicit Google API Translation is reactivated until breach of soft cap

#### Machine Learning API

ML API currently has an upper bound limit of 10 million characters translated per month. This upper bond if not hard coded in to RITA, however it is checked periodically throughout the month. If a User exceeds this a custom tier cost or solution may be required, however no suspension will happen as a result of this limit.
