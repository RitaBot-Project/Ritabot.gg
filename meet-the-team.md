## The Owners

### Artanis - CDO

> **Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Development & Core Staff

<details>

<summary>Z3US - Core Developer</summary>

My skills centre in IT and Telephony.&#x20;

I have a focus on newer style technologies such as VoIP and Cloud Distributed SIP environments, however I also have a strong grounding in older Siemens Telephony systems (HighPath 3k, Realities).&#x20;

My hobby happens to be coding, I focus on Powershell and NodeJS. Hence my possition here at RITABot. While I am still a beginner, I never stop learning new things.&#x20;

I am proficient in Windows, MacOS and Linux, and have started learning Unix in the form of BSD. The main focus behind this is so that any task I take on, I am not limited by my knowledge of the Operating system involved.&#x20;

I never shy away from a challenge and always find a way to improve.

<summary>Brozer - Database Developer</summary>

At work, i'm a DBA on the development side who help dev teams (over 600 people) to modelize their data into RDBMS like PostgreSQL and Oracle. I also help them to build secured databases, evolutive with perf guarantees. As a support member, I also give them lessons on fundamentals like how to code properly in SQL ANSI, how to choose a database to fit their needs (relational Vs NoSQL) and how to improve their physical model in adequation with the datas they want to store in, even for huge storage / huge sollicitations.

Well, my skills are SQL ANSI, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQLite, Flyway (for CI/CD ), bash, .... (REDIS comming soon). And i'm confortable on Windows and Linux OS. I just have to improve my english :smile:

My hobbies are mainly development, that's why i joined RITA Team for learning and helping on Node.js and Sequelize with my "DB skills" first. I also code for my home automation (bash, Lua, JSON, XML, SQLite, ...)

<summary>Trainer Paul - Senior Helper</summary>

I have a long history of Dos, Windows, Database building, and Server building experience, but nothing compared to the combined knowledge of the Rita team. Why Trainer? I used to actually train employees, and a Electrical instructor of years past. I support the Rita team, users, and helping is one of my qualities. Thanks Rita team for closing the gap on communication for all members on Discord.
