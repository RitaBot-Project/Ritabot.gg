# Introduction

## Intro

RitaBot is a fast, automatic & free Discord Translating Bot. Allowing communication across the language barrier from features like automatic-channel translation, to flag reaction translations and many more.

Rita was created because of the drive to communicate with others. Chatting platforms are awesome things and allow fast & simple communication across the entire word. However, something as simple as translating messages for others to understand can become so complicated. Across the internet there are hundreds of translation bots but a flaw in many of them is increasing costs, changing features & overall difficulty to use.

This is where RitaBot came in. Many bots feature translations which are pricey due to hosting costs & translation costs. Rita, however, is a donation-based bot & getting translations for free straight from the Google Translation API.

In this guide we will teach you to get your very own RitaBot in your server, with no coding knowledge required.
