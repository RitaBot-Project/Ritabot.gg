* Channeltypes are either compared with ChannelType.GuildText enum or use of `.isTextBased()`, `.isThread()` or `.isDMBased()` methods
* `MessageEmbed` renamed to `EmbedBuilder`, same for `MessageAttachment` -> `AttachmentBuilder`
* `<Guild>.me` is now `<Guild>.members.me` and can be fetched by `<Guild>.members.fetchMe()`
