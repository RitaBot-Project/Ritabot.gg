  * Has pushed over 55 Updates to [V1.3](../version-history/130.md) Lifecycle&#x20;
  * Fixed countless bugs i have caused :)
* We are in the process of developing a \[REDCATED], more to come soon.
* We have implemented our own [Machine Learning API](https://docs.ritabot.gg/ritabot-docs/\~/changes/V7ZT4uLUneHGTkEpf0wy/policys/s.a.l.t.s-policy#machine-learning-api) (More Below)
* We have Added 19 New Languages for Google API, These can be found [v1.4.0.md](../version-history/v1.4.0/v1.4.0.md "mention")
* ...

## RITA is Almost 1 Year Old, Again

## A Year of RITA (Well...)

2022 saw over 780 new users subscribe to RITA! At the start of 2022 RITA was using version 1.3.0, now as we start 2023 RITA is using version 1.3.24. Thanks to the tireless work of the RITA development team. More than 150 individual updates, fixes, and patches have been made. Resulting in over 32,000 lines of new code being added and nearly 16,000 lines of code being deleted due to refactoring and optimization.&#x20;

**RITA Message Statistics for 2022:** &#x20;

* Total characters translated by RITA = **949,434,521**&#x20;
* Total messages translated by RITA = **17,749,158**&#x20;
* Translations sent by RITA in embed off mode = **13,119,780**&#x20;
* Translations sent by RITA in embed mode = **7,267,768**&#x20;
* Pictures sent by RITA = **462,227**&#x20;
* Number of messages translated via flag emoji reactions = **155,512**&#x20;
* Gif’s sent by RITA = **131,845**&#x20;

Numbers like this are what keeps us going, knowing that you truly use RITA to her full potential!&#x20;

## **Machine Learning (ML)**

As of July 2022, and as part of the RITA development process, We have been working to create our very own machine-learning translation model.&#x20;

For those who aren’t familiar with a machine learning model or a neural network. Instead of relying on Google to translate the messages. We are using various data sets to train the machine learning model via different means so that eventually we can offer an even lower-cost translation bot. With the same level of translation quality, you’ve come to expect and depend on from RITA. This is a long process and we don't expect to be seeing immediate returns on this investment for a while yet, but the aim has always been to provide a service that is affordable and reliable for all of our users.&#x20;

The total character translated with RITA’s ML engine as of 01/01/2023 was **9,721,043**

## 2023 So Far

**RITA Message Statistics for 2023 So Far:** &#x20;

* Total characters translated by RITA = **325,017,612** - (_949,434,521 Last Year_)
* Total messages translated by RITA = **12,151,259 -** (_17,749,158 Last Year_)
* Translations sent by RITA in embed off mode = **8,145,058** - (_13,119,780 Last Year_)
* Translations sent by RITA in embed mode = **3,928,184** - (7,267,768 _Last Year_)
* Pictures sent by RITA = **231,307 -** (_462,227 Last Year_)
* Number of messages translated via flag emoji reactions = **78,017** - (_155,512 Last Year_)
* Gif’s sent by RITA = **60,490** - (_131,845 Last Year_)

As you can see, We are holding strong, and expect to see the number exceeding previous usage by the same point this year.

## ~~Comming Soon~~ New Features

See what I did there, I edited the Title, and now you can do the same in RITA.

With 1.4.0 we have introduced Message editing, At the moment it will always use our ML Engine until we can work out how much of an impact it will have on usage, and how we quantify that usage. so the [#supported-languages](06-04-2023.md#supported-languages "mention") for message editing are the same as the support languages for translation. If the language is not supported the edited message won't be translated.&#x20;

## The Boring Stuff

So now on to a boring topic for most, (Is it sad I really enjoy this part), we have had to make some changes to our policy documents. Please see the respective docuemtns for the changes.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These Policies take effect as of May 01, 2023, Until then the preceding version are still in effect.
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="../policys/s.a.l.t.s-policy/" %}
[s.a.l.t.s-policy](../policys/s.a.l.t.s-policy/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../policys/privacy-policy/" %}
[privacy-policy](../policys/privacy-policy/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../policys/refund-policy.md" %}
[refund-policy.md](../policys/refund-policy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

And finally the changes and their Right to Exit implications and changes.

{% content-ref url="../policys/right-to-exit.md" %}
[right-to-exit.md](../policys/right-to-exit.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Thats a Wrap**

Thats it for now, but we will have some more info for you when we can. and if you want to check out all the changes made, dive into our change logs over in [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

> From all the Development Team at RITA, See you soon.&#x20;
