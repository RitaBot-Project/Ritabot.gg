## **RITA Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (ML) Work In Progress**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
As of July of 2022, a part of the RITA development team has been hard at work creating our very own machine learning translation model.
 
For those who aren’t familiar with a machine learning model or a neural network. Instead of relying on Google to translate the messages.
 
We are using various data sets to train the machine learning model via different means so that eventually we can offer an even lower cost translation bot.
 
With the same level of translation quality you’ve come to expect and depend on from RITA. This is still very much in the early stages of development, so far thanks to numerous training iterations we have decent coverage for the following 11 languages:
 
English, German, Russian, Spanish, French, Romanian, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. 

Please stay tuned for more information regarding the ML progress RITA is making.
 
Total character translated with RITA’s ML engine = 9,721,043
