## **BETA TESTERS WANTED**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
As RITA moves into the next phase and new features are implemented we want to be able to test RITA without impacting the wider user base with potential bugs resulting in downtime. This is where you, our users, can help. 

What We are looking for in BETA Testers: 
```
{% endcode %}

## **How many do we need?**&#x20;

<pre class="language-javascript" data-overflow="wrap"><code class="lang-javascript"><strong>To start with we are looking for 5 servers willing to be BETA Testers. 
</strong></code></pre>

## **Are there any restrictions?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
You must have no more than 100 tasks, a monthly usage limit of no more than 500k characters and more than 20 users. For simplicity of communication, you must be proficient in communicating in English. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **What do I need to do?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
Open a general ticket in open-a-ticket providing your server ID, and stating you want to be a BETA Tester. One of the admin team will evaluate your server to ensure it meets our requirements. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **What next?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
You will be invited to install a separate version of RITA on your server. This version is invite-only and will only work on the servers we approve.
```
{% endcode %}

## **Will I need to set everything up again?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
No, your tasks will be intact and RITA will start working straight away. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **What do I have to do as a BETA Tester?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
The simple answer, use BITA as normal, we will create a separate ticket where you will report any issue you find. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **Are there any downsides?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
While we will continue to try and provide a guaranteed uptime like Global RITA there may be a time when BETA RITA stops working. 

New features we add may be removed and you may find random bugs. 

Your feedback will help us to fix these and get them ready for global launch. 

You won't be able to have more than 1000 Tasks. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **What's in it for me?**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
This is the best bit, we will provide RITA for free. 

Through the BETA Platform. So you won't have to pay for a subscription. 

There will be rules but we will let you know them before you agree. 
```
{% endcode %}

## **But.......**&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
Some codeUpdates may be made multiple times a day, with reboot times being an average of 5 mins. We can't always guarantee notification of reboots. 

But we will let you know of any changes. 

BETA RITA is not a permanent bot, and while we will give you as much notice as we can it may be deactivated at any time.
```
