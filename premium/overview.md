# Overview

## About Subscribing

In order to subscribe to RitaBot, _you must be on our_ [_**Discord Server**_](https://discord.gg/mgNR64R)_._ **** Subscriptions are role-based, meaning that Rita updates subscriptions based on which roles you have been given by the payment platform (which tier you have bought). If you leave the server, Rita will cancel your subscription at the end of a one-month period from the last subscription date, even if your subscription is still active.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For any queries you may have in regards to subscriptions, please proceed to <mark style="color:blue;">#open-a-ticket</mark> in our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/mgNR64R).
{% endhint %}

## Maintenance and Uptime

There may be times RitaBot ceases to function, in which the procedure for us will be to verify the problem and fix it as soon as possible. We are not responsible for any issues this may cause.&#x20;

Furthermore, there may be times of maintenance in order to improve and exceed Rita's capabilities.\
\
In line with our [Refund Policy](../policys/refund-policy.md), We Aim for a service uptime of >80% (24 Days in a rolling 30 day period) of core functionality.

## Servers

Currently, **only the server owner** can buy a subscription for a server. Furthermore, _only one server can be activated with your subscription at a time_. This will be liable to change in the future as time goes on.

## How to Activate?

To activate your subscription after you have paired your Discord Account to your payment, you must run the **`!tr sub`** command in the <mark style="color:blue;">#activate-rita-here</mark> channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mgNR64R), after you do so follow the prompts to activate your subscription for the specific server.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In order to subscribe and maintain said subscription, you MUST be on our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/mgNR64R)**.** If you cannot or are not, your subscription will be cancelled at the end of a 1-month period from the last verification date (the last 1-month period from the subscription start where the subscription was confirmed).
