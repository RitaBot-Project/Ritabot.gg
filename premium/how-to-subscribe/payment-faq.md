<summary>Why have been charged too much?</summary>

This may only happen with Patreon.\
\
Patreon rounds up to the nearest .5 increment of your currency. This is not something we are able to overcome, this is how Patreon works.

<summary>Why have I been charged twice by Patreon?</summary>

Patreon always charges on the 1st of each month.\
\
For example, if your purchase a subscription on the 28th of April. You will be charged for a month, and then charged again on the 1st of May. This is done every calendar month and is called upfront charging.\
